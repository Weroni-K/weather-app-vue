# Weather App ðŸŒ¦ðŸŒ¤

Welcome :wave: to the Weather App created in Vue.js.

### Project description ðŸ“œ

This project presents single page website with weather forecast. The forecast is based on users' location search. The background changes dynamically based on the current weather conditions. I decided to develop the project using Vue.js, CSS and Axios API.


### Future improvement ideas:

-update background images for few weather conditions (rain, showers, fog)
-to improve the visibility of the title, replace it with the app logo
